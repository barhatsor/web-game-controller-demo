This project attempts to make the [Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) and [Gamepad Haptics API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPKzVRNzzU4dUsvLpSXm1VXPQZ8FP-0lKMT-R_p-s6g) in JavaScript accessible and easier to use.

As of now, there's no real simple, organized documentation of the APIs mentioned above. This project attempts to gather all of the available info from W3C drafts and put it into action.

So if you wanted to have some controller action in your web game, I hope I made your day a little bit better :)

The [Gamepad API Test](https://luser.github.io/gamepadtest/) by [luser](https://github.com/luser) was a great point of reference in putting this together.  
The styling's based off of [Discord](https://discord.gg)'s styling.
