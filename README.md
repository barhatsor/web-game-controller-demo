This project attempts to make the [Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) and [Gamepad Haptics API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPKzVRNzzU4dUsvLpSXm1VXPQZ8FP-0lKMT-R_p-s6g) in JavaScript accesible and easier to use.

As of now, there is no organized documentation of the APIs mentioned above. This project attempts to gather all the available info from W3C drafts and put it into action.

So if you wanted to have some controller action in your web game, I hope I made your day a little bit better :)

A tool that really helped me out when putting this together is the [Gamepad API Test](https://luser.github.io/gamepadtest/) by [luser](https://github.com/luser).

The styling is based off of [Discord's styling](https://discord.gg).
